# Simon-Game

This project presents a replica of the classic Simon game, as the course project for [Angela Yu's Web Development course on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

The course provides skeleton files of HTML, CSS and sounds; the Javascript is written from scratch following the course hints and instructions.

Demo site (example site) of the game can be found [here](https://londonappbrewery.github.io/Simon-Game/).
Refer to [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)#Gameplay) for game rules explanation.
